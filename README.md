### Project Tracking
- Group patterns into projects with progress tracking
- Built-in row and stitch counters with keyboard shortcuts
- Unlimited custom counters per pattern

### Backup & Restore
- Manual and scheduled backups (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Selective backup options (PDFs, markdown, archive, notes)
- Auto-prune old backups by count or age

## Installation
### Quick Start
Yarnl is easy to get up and running with Docker. You'll be crocheting in no time. 

**Prerequisites:** 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Open terminal and run the following commands:

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
mkdir yarnl && cd yarnl
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titandrive/yarnl/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
mkdir yarnl; cd yarnl
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titandrive/yarnl/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yml"
docker compose up -d
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

By default, Yarnl starts in single-user mode with an `admin` account and no password.

To configure passwords, timezone, and other options, download the [`.env.example`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titandrive/yarnl/main/.env.example) file, rename it to `.env`, and edit as needed before starting.

### Docker Compose

If you prefer to write the compose file yourself instead of downloading it:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    container_name: yarnl-db
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    volumes:
      - yarnl-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=yarnl
      - POSTGRES_USER=yarnl
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yarnl
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U yarnl"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  yarnl:
    container_name: yarnl
    image: titandrive/yarnl:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./users:/app/users
      # Optional: mount an external path for backups
      # - /mnt/user/drive:/backups
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PORT=5432
      - POSTGRES_DB=yarnl
      - POSTGRES_USER=yarnl
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yarnl
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=
      - TZ=UTC
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  yarnl-postgres-data:
```

## Configuration

Most configuration is done via settings once Yarnl is up and running. There are a few environment variables available to customize your installation:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `yarnl` | Database name |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `yarnl` | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `yarnl` | Database password |
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | `postgres` | Database hostname (use default with Docker Compose) |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `5432` | Database port |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Initial admin username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Admin password (empty = passwordless login) |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port exposed on the host |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Defaults to `production` in the Docker image |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Timezone for scheduled backups |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set to `true` to mark session cookies as HTTPS-only |
| `FORCE_LOCAL_LOGIN` | `false` | Force local login even when OIDC/SSO is configured |

### OIDC / SSO (Optional)

OIDC is configured through the admin settings panel in the app (Settings > Admin > SSO). Yarnl supports any OpenID Connect provider with auto-discovery. If SSO is misconfigured and you get locked out, set `FORCE_LOCAL_LOGIN=true` to bypass SSO and log in with your local credentials.

## Data Persistence

All user data is stored in the `./users` directory on the host, mounted as a Docker volume:
- Pattern files (PDFs, markdown, images)
- Thumbnails
- Notes
- Archive
- Backups

The PostgreSQL database uses a named Docker volume (`yarnl-postgres-data`) for metadata, counters, and settings.

## Development

### Running without Docker

1. Install **Node.js** (v18+) and **PostgreSQL**
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set database environment variables
4. Start the server: `npm start`

### Development with Docker

Clone the repo and create a `docker-compose.override.yml` to build from source and mount the public directory for live editing:

```yaml
services:
  yarnl:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./public:/app/public
```

Then run `docker compose up -d --build`.

# Yarnl Release Notes

## v0.6.9

### Features
- **Repeatable counters** — counters can now cycle back to 1 after reaching a set limit. Open the settings cog on any counter and toggle **Repeat** on, then set the row count. When the counter reaches the limit, the next increment resets it to 1. Useful for tracking repeating stitch patterns (e.g., a 10-row repeat on a dishcloth).
- **Linked main counter** — one counter per pattern can be designated as the **Main** counter. When any other counter is incremented or decremented, the main counter automatically follows. This lets you track both overall row count and repeat position at the same time. The main counter itself increments normally without double-counting.
- **Counter settings pane** — the delete button on counters has been replaced with a settings cog. Clicking it reveals an inline settings view with Main and Repeat toggles, a Done button, and a Delete button (requires two clicks to confirm). The counter name hides while settings are open to keep the layout compact.
- **Main counter color indicator** — the main counter's name is displayed in the accent color so you can tell at a glance which counter is linked, without taking up extra space with a badge.

### UI Polish
- **Custom repeat stepper** — the repeat value input uses styled −/+ buttons instead of native browser spinners, matching the rest of the UI
- **Compact counter-max display** — when a repeat limit is set, the counter shows the value as `11/2` with the max in a smaller, muted font
- **Mobile counter nav in edit mode** — the bottom navigation arrows now update the edit panel when it's open, removing the need for the redundant upper navigation row
- **Disabled main toggle** — when one counter is already set as main, the Main toggle on other counters is greyed out with a tooltip explaining which counter holds the main role

### Bug Fixes
- **Header theme toggle not saving** — the light/dark toggle in the header now syncs to the server immediately, matching the behavior of the settings picker

---

## v0.6.8

### Features
- **Mobile landscape support** — landscape phones now use the mobile UI with compact bars, maximizing PDF viewing area
- **Counter tap to close** — tapping the counter label again closes the edit panel (same as pressing Done)

### Infrastructure
- **Auto-detect backup mount** — external backup drive is detected automatically, removing the need for a `BACKUP_PATH` env var

---

## v0.6.7

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix Catppuccin dark mode** — Catppuccin dark theme was missing counter button color variables, causing them to fall back to default Lavender colors

---

## v0.6.6

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix sessions over plain HTTP** — session cookies no longer require HTTPS, so accessing Yarnl over HTTP on a LAN works correctly
- **Fix settings lost on quick refresh** — settings changes (theme, etc.) now sync to the server immediately on modal close and flush on page unload, preventing loss from the 2-second debounce window

### Configuration
- **`SECURE_COOKIES` env var** — set to `true` to mark session cookies as HTTPS-only (defaults to `false`)

---

## v0.6.5

### Infrastructure
- **Simplified `BACKUP_PATH`** — now a boolean flag (`true`) instead of a path; set `BACKUP_PATH=true` and add a volume mount to `/backups` in docker-compose to store backups on an external drive or NAS (existing `/backups` value still works)

### Docs
- Add Docker Compose install link to README prerequisites

---

## v0.6.4

### Features
- **Synced scrolling for live preview** — markdown editor and preview panes scroll in sync across all editors (new pattern, inline edit, pattern notes)
- **Inline editor live preview** — existing markdown patterns now have a side-by-side live preview toggle when editing
- **Image drag-and-drop** — drag images directly into any markdown editor (previously paste-only)
- **Image paste in pattern notes** — paste images from clipboard into PDF pattern notes
- **Catppuccin theme** — new Catppuccin Latte (light) and Mh
- Add Windows PowerShell quickstart instructions to README

---

## v0.6.3

### Features
- **Configurable inactivity timeout** — set how long before the auto timer pauses, or disable it entirely (Settings > Appearance > Inactivity Timeout)

### Bug Fixes
- **Timer saves reliably on exit** — timer seconds are cached locally when closing a pattern, preventing lost time from server save race conditions

### UI Polish
- **Centered mobile page number** — page indicator is now centered between the title and timer in mobile view

---

## v0.6.2

### Features
- **What's New popup toggle** — disable the release notes popup from Settings > Appearance > Notifications

### Bug Fixes
- **Auto timer persists on exit** — timer state is preserved when leaving and re-opening a pattern
- **PDF timer save on close** — timer now correctly saves to the server when closing the PDF viewer

---

## v0.6.1

### Bug Fixes
- **Auto timer resumes on tab return** — timer now restarts automatically when switching back to the tab, instead of staying stopped

---

## v0.6.0

### Features
- **Dark-only theme toggle** — day/night toggle is hidden for themes that lack a light mode (e.g., Midnight, Synthwave, Dracula)

### UI Polish
- **No more flash on refresh** — settings/back button, theme toggle, and tab highlights all render correctly from the first frame
- **Centered header title** — "Yarnl" logo stays locked in center when switching between Settings and Back buttons

---

## v0.5.9

### Bug Fixes
- Fix "What's New" popup not showing for users upgrading from versions before the feature existed

---

## v0.5.8

### Performance
- **PDF viewer caching** — PDFs are cached between close/reopen, eliminating the white flash on revisit
- **Annotation-aware cache busting** — PDF cache updates automatically after annotation saves

### Features
- **"What's New" popup** — changelog shown automatically on version update

### Bug Fixes
- Fix annotation save crash caused by null `matchMedia` result in PDF.js

---

## v0.5.7

### Performance
- **Gzip compression** — All responses are now compressed, reducing transfer sizes by ~75% (app.js: 559KB → ~120KB)
- **Static asset caching** — CSS, JS, and images cached for 7 days with `?v=` cache busting for updates

### Markdown Editor
- Improved layout — editor and preview now fill the full screen (reduced excess bottom padding)
- Save status now color-coded: green for saved, muted for saving, red for errors
- "Done" button replaces "Preview" toggle on desktop for cleaner workflow
- Mobile-optimized create form — fixed action bar at bottom, compact layout, smaller thumbnail

### Projects
- **Thumbnail play overlay** — replaces the Continue button at the bottom of project cards, keeping card heights consistent with pattern cards
- **Context-aware hashtag filtering** — clicking a hashtag on a project card filters the projects tab; clicking on a pattern card filters the library tab
- Project badge color changed to secondary (pink) to distinguish from category badges

### Infrastructure
- `NODE_ENV=production` now defaults in the Dockerfile — no longer needed in docker-compose
- **BACKUP_PATH env var** — configure custom backup storage location
- Fix backup migration across Docker volume mounts
- Upgrade multer to 2.0.2 (fixes 4 high-severity DoS vulnerabilities)
